### Question 1: Can I manage user access and subscription + usage billing with Stripe and not need Chargebee?
Yes, you can manage user access, subscriptions, and usage-based billing using Stripe without the need for Chargebee. Stripe offers a comprehensive suite of tools to handle billing models, including metered or usage-based billing. 

#### Key Features:
1. **Subscription Management**: Stripe Billing enables subscription creation and management with flexible billing cycles.
2. **Usage-Based Billing**: Stripe supports metered billing models and allows usage data recording for accurate customer billing.
3. **Customer Portal**: Stripe provides a pre-built portal for managing subscriptions and payment methods.
4. **Invoicing**: Generate and automate invoicing processes for recurring and one-time charges.
5. **Entitlements**: Determine customer access based on their subscription plan.

#### Advantages:
- Unified platform for payments, subscriptions, and billing.
- Scalable infrastructure.
- Extensive documentation and support.

### Question 2: Can Stripe help manage user access?
Stripe offers tools to manage internal user roles and permissions, such as:
1. **Team Management and Roles**: Assign roles like Admin, Developer, Analyst, or Support Specialist.
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Use centralized authentication for your organization.
3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Add an extra layer of security.
4. **Customer Portal**: A customizable portal for end-users to manage subscriptions and payment details.

While Stripe helps with internal user roles and customer subscription management, it doesn't handle web application user creation and access control.

### Question 3: Can Stripe handle managing user creation and access for the web app, or will AWS handle that?
Stripe is primarily focused on payment processing and doesn't manage user authentication or access control for a web app. For user creation and access control, **AWS Cognito** is recommended. It provides:
- User Pools for managing authentication.
- Identity Pools for providing temporary credentials.
- Multi-factor authentication and password policies.

By integrating AWS Cognito for user management and Stripe for billing, you can effectively handle both aspects of your web application.
